This documentation describes the modelling and analysis of climate-related risks to transport
networks in Vietnam.

The modelling and analysis aims to support decision-making by identifying the performance of
adaptation options under current and future scenarios. It comprises a network flow model,
generation of failure scenarios, economic impact assessment, and cost-benefit analysis of
adaptation options.
